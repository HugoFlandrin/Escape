## 📜 **Project Description**  
**Escape** is a first-person thriller game developed in **Unreal Engine 5**, blending exploration, tension, and puzzles.  
You wake up in a dark, unfamiliar room. The air is heavy, and the silence, oppressive. Something’s wrong — and the only thing at your side is a flickering flashlight.

Your goal?  
**Escape.**  
But nothing is that simple...

Inspired by real-life **escape rooms**, **Escape** offers an immersive and unsettling experience where every detail matters. You'll need to solve disturbing puzzles, piece together fragmented memories through photographs, and uncover the reason behind your captivity — all before it's too late. Don’t take your time...
